# Progress

## 1. What Works (Current State)
- **AI Writer (Foundation & Initial UI):**
  - `AiWriterContext.tsx` created and expanded to manage the multi-step script generation process (source fetching, placeholder for analysis, placeholder for outline generation, user selections, final script). Includes state for `videoIdea`, `sources`, `researchAnalysis`, `scriptComponents`, `userSelectedComponents`, `finalScript`, and associated loading/error states and functions (`triggerSearch`, `analyzeAndGenerateOutlines`, `generateFinalScript`).
  - Integration of AI Writer search with `SearchInput.tsx` on the main page (`page.tsx`):
    - "AI Writer Search Mode" toggle added.
    - If active, submitting an idea triggers source fetching via `/api/test-gemini-search`, navigates to `/ai-writer`, and uses `AiWriterContext` to pass data.
  - `AiWriterPage` (`/ai-writer`) structure:
    - Uses standard app layout (`AppSidebar`, `MainContent`).
    - `TabsUnderlinedDemo` for "Research", "Outline", "Script" tabs.
    - "Research" tab displays fetched `sources` as a 3x3 grid of `ClientTweetCard` components.
    - `ThinkingTimeline.tsx` component displays during processing initiated from `SearchInput.tsx`.
  - Supporting components created: `ClientTweetCard.tsx`, `TweetSkeleton.tsx`, `ThinkingTimeline.tsx`.
  - API route `/api/test-gemini-search/route.ts` for fetching sources based on a video idea using Gemini and Google Custom Search.
  - Styling updates for AI Writer tabs (Perplexity-inspired, Poppins font, increased underline/font size).
- **Git:** All AI Writer foundation changes committed and pushed.
- **Firebase:** Initial setup for Firebase Auth and Firestore (secondary priority).
- **Project Setup:** Core dependencies installed, initial directory structure, Memory Bank established.

## 2. What's Left to Build (High-Level)
- **AI Writer - Full Workflow Implementation:**
  - **API Development:**
    - Implement API route for **analyzing sources** (Input: `Source[]`, `videoIdea`; Output: `ResearchAnalysis`).
    - Implement API route for **generating script components/outlines** (Input: `ResearchAnalysis`; Output: `ScriptComponents` - hooks, factsets, takes, outros).
    - Implement/Refine API route for **generating final script** (Input: `UserSelectedScriptComponents`, `videoIdea`; Output: final script text).
  - **Context (`AiWriterContext.tsx`) Integration:**
    - Replace placeholder logic in `analyzeAndGenerateOutlines` with actual calls to the new analysis and outline generation APIs.
    - Implement logic in `generateFinalScript` to call the final script generation API.
  - **UI Development (`AiWriterPage.tsx`):**
    - **"Outline" Tab:** UI to display `scriptComponents` (options for hooks, factsets, etc.), allow user selection to populate `userSelectedComponents`, handle loading/error states for this stage. UI for pre-existing templates if pursued.
    - **"Script" Tab:** UI to display the `finalScript`, trigger `generateFinalScript`, handle loading/error states.
    - Determine and implement the trigger mechanism for `analyzeAndGenerateOutlines` (e.g., button on "Research" tab after sources load).
    - Comprehensive loading, error, and empty state handling throughout the AI Writer flow.
- **Core App Features (from original brief, if not superseded by AI Writer focus):**
    - Landing page elements (category pills, video recommendations - if still relevant).
    - Video player integration on the right side of a split view (if this UI paradigm is maintained).
    - AI Chat Assistant tab functionality.
- **Firebase Integration:**
    - Complete authentication flow (login, signup, logout).
    - Firestore integration for user data persistence if/when needed.
- **General UI Polish & UX:**
    - Responsive design improvements.
    - Accessibility review.
    - Consistent error handling and user feedback.

## 3. Current Status
- **AI Writer Feature Development: IN PROGRESS** (Foundation laid, research step functional, context expanded. Next: Analysis, Outline, Final Script APIs and UI).
- **Firebase Integration: PAUSED** (Initial setup done, full integration deferred).
- **Core Landing Page/Video Discovery: PAUSED/PENDING REDEFINITION** (Focus shifted to AI Writer).

## 4. Known Issues/Blockers
- Precise data structure for `ResearchAnalysis` needs to be defined to align with AI model requirements for outline generation.
- Decision on user interaction flow for triggering analysis and outline steps (manual vs. automatic).
