      "The initial hook is highly effective in grabbing attention.  A surprising statement immediately piques viewer interest.",

  "transcript": "Nobody cares about you is something that was never made clear to me. And I mean that in the most positive, optimistic, inspiring, motivating way. Especially if you see yourself as a creative or you want to exist on YouTube or as a filmmaker, or a musician, or as an artist, or a painter, or any of those things. Like you think that everybody's paying attention. And because of that it kind of controls how you think. And even when I was young and fearless and nothing to lose, I was still so cognizant of like, how are people gonna react to this? And what's the best way to do like I was so aware. And the reality is nobody gives a shit. Everybody is so focused on themselves in this world, nobody has time for you. And the sooner you accept that as a creative person, the sooner you're free. Like you're totally free. Like do exactly what feels right to you. And if you can get yourself on that trajectory, then it goes back to what we were talking about before, about being novel, about being original, about not being a photocopy of somebody who did something. If you're that photocopy, you will never be the original. But the moment you accept the fact that nobody cares, do your thing, nobody cares. And then you start to go down that path, you will just get better and better and better. Then you sprinkle on that patience I was talking about, you just keep going. You keep going. And like your moment of explosion, your your detonation will happen.",
