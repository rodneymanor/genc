        "feedback": "The hook immediately addresses a pain point for content creators and piques curiosity. The slightly repetitive phrasing is a minor issue but the overall effect is strong.",

    "improvedScript": "Are you sabotaging your content by being too bland? Many creators try to appeal to everyone, but this actually hurts their reach.  People connect with authenticity, not generic niceness. Your fear of judgment is holding you back from sharing your unique perspective.  This fear keeps you from showing your true personality, which prevents others from truly seeing who you are and connecting with you.

      "The initial hook strongly grabs attention, demonstrating the importance of identifying and immediately addressing viewer pain points.",
      "The script relies too heavily on profanity and lacks a clear structure. It should focus on clear points, strong transitions, and a compelling call to action to maximize its impact."

  "transcript": "I think that you know that you're doing this when you create content, if you create content, if you've thought of creating content. And this is a manifestation of something you do in the real world. So, I'm just going to tell you what it is, so we can get the f*** past it. And right after this video, you can go on creating content and living a version of your life that actually gets engagement, gets the views, gets the likes that you want. And also in life that you actually start to have the impact that you yearn to have. My name is Justin Shuman. Humans is in my last name and and and teaching you how to human publicly in progress on purpose. Like being an intentional version of yourself, that's what I want to do for you. And the thing that I'm talking about is you are making yourself so bland and general for two reasons. One, you think it makes you more relatable, which is untrue. Specificity is actually what people find relatable. And two, your fear of how people will judge you and how people will perceive you is what is holding you back in content. It's what's holding you back in the world. Through your life you are basically giving this like diet version of you. I work with people to bring their authentic presence onto social to collect those fragmented pieces of themselves and craft a cohesive brand online. But if you want to do that with me, like go in my bio apply, we can work together. There's a point way the f*** back here because you've been doing this behavior for so long that you probably don't even feel it or realize it anymore that you have really unpopular, specific, angular, spiky opinions about shit. But you don't share them because they go through so many filters before the idea actually comes out of your mouth because you're so afraid of what will people think of me if I say this? Will they talk about me behind my back? The answer also truly is that you'll never f***ing know, so it doesn't really matter. Truly, truly, truly, truly, truly answer me, what does it matter? You are here one time, and if you are going to allow the perception that other people might have of you to be the thing that dictates your thoughts and your actions and your behaviors, you are letting everyone else in the world run your life except for you. Why? What like what what's the game that you never get embarrassed? That you never feel cringy? Because spoiler alert, that's going to happen regardless, no matter which path you choose. So why not choose a path in which you, sure, maybe not everyone likes you, because guess what, not everyone's going to like you anyway. So you're just choosing the path of honoring your realness before trying to preemptively manage the judgment of others. But when this shit comes out of your mouth, are you even saying what you really want to be saying? I want to remind you that in life and on social, if you don't stand for anything, we cannot stand with you. We can't want you on our team because I don't know who the f*** you are. I don't know what you believe in. If in life or on social, I can't tell if your values align with mine, there's no f***ing way I'm putting you in my pocket either like as a follow you on social or in my contact list thing. Do you think you're helping yourself by making yourself general and relatable? You're not. You're holding yourself back, and you're keeping people who might want you on their team from knowing you at all.",
