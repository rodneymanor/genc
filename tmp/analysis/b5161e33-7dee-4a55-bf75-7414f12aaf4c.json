  "transcript": "Under what circumstances might the founder of a major AI company be just flat-out wrong? That's an interesting question I've been pondering because Dario Amadei, the founder of Anthropic, which is the maker of Claude, a major AI model, competitor of Chad GPT, went on the record this week saying half of all entry-level jobs are going to go away in five years. But there is controversy here because at the same time, same week, shots fired, major leaders at Shopify, the CEO of GitHub, one of the most influential engineers on the planet, Greg Oriosh, all fired back and said that is ridiculous because the complexity of code at enterprise scale is not something that AI is adequately addressing. And because if you want to hire entry-level roles for culture change, it has never been a better time. And Shopify and GitHub are putting their money where their mouth is on that one because they are both instituting big hiring programs for entry-level engineering roles. They want more junior engineers because they say that gets AI native engineers into their talent stack. And that lines up with what Sam Altman, the founder of OpenAI, creator of Chad GPT, et cetera, among many creators of Chad GPT, he said that what he has observed about Chad GPT usage is that young people use it like an operating system and elderly people, I should probably put myself in this category, uh, tend to use it just for questions and answers. Um, and that's a huge difference. It's a huge difference. If you run your life through an operating system on AI like it it informs everything you do. And that is the kind of mindset that leaders at GitHub and Shopify are saying they're looking for. In fact, Shopify characterized this as they want an AI Centaur, a like AI plus LLM hybrid, right? Like basically you should be so native that LLM feels like an extension of yourself is the vibe. Fine. The point is these are very, very different points of view on where we are going on something that should matter to all of us. There shots have been fired. Um, when you think about it that way, I want to suggest to you that the smart take here is not to care particularly about which belief system is true because it kind of is a belief system. Instead, we should borrow from Pascal's wager, which is hundreds of years old. And the idea is if you don't know if something is true or not, what is the most rational way to prepare for your future? That's how we should think about this. And I want to argue that the Gergely camp, the uh, camp that just sort of goes for entry-level engineers and kind of that there will still be jobs, is the more rational thing to prepare for because if Dario is right, and if you just spend your time being a doomer and expecting universal basic income and waiting, you're in big trouble on your career. Big, big trouble if you're wrong. Whereas if Gergely is right, if the CEO of GitHub is right, and there's more jobs coming, then preparing is absolutely the right thing and you won't get it any other way, right? Like you have to prepare to go hit those those career goals. And by the way, these are different kinds of skills. You have to develop human skills because increasingly, uh, employers are looking to interview you in person to avoid these sort of AI cheating uh, apps that come up on the screen that help you pass these interviews. So you have to cultivate human connection, you have to cultivate presence, you have to cultivate these sort of traditionally human wisdom skills. You also have to cultivate problem-solving skills. And here's the tie-in to Dario's world. Dario agrees that we will be in a world where people will manage fleets of bots. Guess what you need? You need high-level agency and problem-solving skills to do that as well. So you win either way. And I think that elevates the conversation above arguing over who is right. We can let people fight that out. That's fine. Let them have their big conversation. We have practical things we can do to get ready for this world either way. If you want to dive deeper on this, I did put up a Substack that goes way deep on this, the skills you need to prepare for all of that. And I'm just going to give you a hint on this one. This one is uh, whatever the setting is, I set it so that if you're a free subscriber, you can redeem it and this is like your view of a post and you can get a full paid post for free. So just I I don't know quite how it works on the reader's side, but that's the setting I clicked in Substack, and I'm sure you can figure it out. Uh, but the net net of it is if you sign up, you should be able to get a hold of the post. Um, and I think it's phenomenal. Um, I think it's really important to think about what we can do practically and not just think about whose side is right. And I hear so much of whose side is right, and I would much rather talk about what we can develop. And like, tell me where I'm wrong. Tell me where you think that you have sort of skills that that you would like to develop that I didn't cover. Put it in the comments. Would love to see it. But dig in, get past the doomer versus optimist spiral and look at what you can concretely develop.",
